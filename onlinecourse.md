## Slack utilization
Slack is computer/tablet/mobile friendly. 
* You can easily share a screen shot or a picture. It will be a great tool for you to ask me questions at any time. You can directly message me (private), and you are also welcome to share your question in the #general channel. 
* You should free to talk to your peers in Slack as well, but make sure you obey all academic policy.
* This is also a great place to drop me a message to schedule a personal zoom meeting outside of office hours. Of course you can stilll email me.

## Changes on syllabus
* Last day to withdraw from the course with “W” is April 17, 2020.
* **Students may choose the S/U grade.  This choice is available to you by May 6.** If you choose S/U, anything equal or above C- is considered S. S/U grading does not have any effect on a student's GPA calculation, but will still allow the classes to count toward degree and financial aid requirements. 
* Homework: no change as we were already doing online homework. 

 **If you were using a scanning device on campus before, you may want to use mobile scanning apps like Adobe Scan, Simple Scan, CamScanner, etc.**

* Quizzes: to be determined
* Final Exam: to be determined
* The weights on Homework, Quiz, Final exam is going to be changed.
