# Spring 2020 Math 377: Intro to Numerical Methods
Instructor: Xuemei Chen, xchen@nmsu.edu

**office hours: T 10:15 - 11:15, R 11:30 - 12:30**

I do tend to be on campus more on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. But feel free to make appointment with me **on any day**. 

This will be the main course website. Canvas is for grades recording and possible announcements.

## Software
For people who don't have Python or Jupyter notebook, a very easy solution is to download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) (Python 3.7 version). 

For people who already have Python but need to install Jupyter notebook, you may still install Anaconda as instructed previously, or install Jupyter notebook following https://jupyter.org/install.html.

All the information above is contained in our [Syllabus](2020SprMath377_syllabus.pdf).
