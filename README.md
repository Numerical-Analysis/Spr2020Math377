# Spring 2020 Math 377: Intro to Numerical Methods
## Main
Instructor: Xuemei Chen, xchen@nmsu.edu

Lecture: TR 9 - 10:15 @SH114

**office hours: T 10:15 - 11:15, R 11:30 - 12:30 @SH230**

I do tend to be on campus more on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. But feel free to make appointment with me **on any day**. 

This will be the main course website. Canvas is for grades recording, homework submission, and possible announcements.

I will post [lecture notes](NumericalMethods20.pdf) and keep updating it.

## Software
For people who don't have Python or Jupyter notebook, a very easy solution is to download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) (Python 3.7 version). 

For people who already have Python but need to install Jupyter notebook, you may still install Anaconda as instructed previously, or install Jupyter notebook following https://jupyter.org/install.html.

The information above is some highlights of our [Syllabus](2020SprMath377_syllabus.pdf).

### Jupyter Notebook
Once you have installed Jupyte Notebook, you can launch it using Anaconda, or you can simply execute "jupyter notebook" in the command line. Here is a [tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-beginners-tutorial-to-jupyter-notebooks-1b2f8705888a) that I found online.
