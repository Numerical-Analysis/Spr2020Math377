# Spring 2020 Math 377: Intro to Numerical Methods
## Main
Instructor: Xuemei Chen, xchen@nmsu.edu

Lecture: TR 9 - 10:15 @SH114

**office hours: T 10:15 - 11:15, R 11:30 - 12:30 @SH230**

I do tend to be on campus more on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. But feel free to make appointment with me **on any day**. 

This will be the main course website. Canvas is for grades recording, homework submission, and possible announcements.

I will post [lecture notes](NumericalMethods20.pdf) and keep updating it.

## Software
For people who don't have Python or Jupyter notebook, a very easy solution is to download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) (Python 3.7 version). 

For people who already have Python but need to install Jupyter notebook, you may still install Anaconda as instructed previously, or install Jupyter notebook following https://jupyter.org/install.html.

The information above is some highlights of our [Syllabus](2020SprMath377_syllabus.pdf).

### Jupyter Notebook
Once you have installed Jupyte Notebook, you can launch it using Anaconda, or you can simply execute "jupyter notebook" in the command line. Here is a [tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-beginners-tutorial-to-jupyter-notebooks-1b2f8705888a) that I found online. 

## HW instructions:

For regular written exercises, you can either scan your work or type up your work (I don't prefer one way or another). In either case, you need to upload ONE SINGLE pdf on Canvas. 

If you don't want to scan, you can turn in a physical copy of your work in class of the same day.
